Welcome to the QETpy documentation
####################################
==================================

QETpy (Quasiparticle-trap-assisted Electrothermal-feedback Transition-edge sensors) provides tools for TES based detector calibration and analysis. It contains submodules for noise modeling, IV analysis, complex impedance fitting, non-linear optimum filter pulse fitting, and many other useful detector R&D analysis tools.

Descriptions of all the functions can be found below, as well as examples of how to use most of the functionality of QETpy.
